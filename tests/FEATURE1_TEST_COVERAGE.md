## Integration Tests (3 tests)

1. **test_multiple_actions_sequence**
   - Tests recording of 5 consecutive actions
   - Validates action order preservation
   - Confirms all actions captured

   - Ensures recording state is respected

3. **test_recording_captures_all_parameters**
   - Validates all function parameters are recorded
   - Tests parameter completeness

## Test Methodology

Each test:
1. Mocks the uiautomator2 device connection
2. Starts a recording session
3. Executes the target action tool
4. Validates:
   - Action was recorded (length check)
   - Tool name is correct
   - Parameters are captured
   - Recording state is maintained
