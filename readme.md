# MCP Android Agent

This project provides an **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** server for automating Android devices using [uiautomator2](https://github.com/openatx/uiautomator2). It's designed to be easily plugged into AI agents like GitHub Copilot Chat, Claude, or Open Interpreter to control Android devices through natural language.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher (tested on 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13)
- Android Debug Bridge (adb) installed and in PATH
- Connected Android device with USB debugging enabled
- [uiautomator2](https://github.com/openatx/uiautomator2) compatible Android device

## Running the Server

### Quick Start (Recommended)

**MCP stdio mode** (for Claude Desktop, VS Code agent mode):
```bash
./start.sh
```

**HTTP mode** (for development/testing):
```bash
./start-http.sh
```

### Manual Start

**Option 1: MCP stdio mode** (For AI agent integration)

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 server.py
```

**Option 2: HTTP mode with uvicorn** (For development/testing)

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn server:app --factory --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Usage

An MCP client is needed to use this server. The Claude Desktop app is an example of an MCP client. To use this server with Claude Desktop:

### Locate your Claude Desktop configuration file

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

### Add the Android MCP server configuration to the mcpServers section

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-android": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "bash",
      "args": [
        "-c",
        "cd /path/to/mcp-adb && source .venv/bin/activate && python -m server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/mcp-adb` with the absolute path to where you cloned this repository. For example: `/Users/username/Projects/mcp-adb`

### Using with Claude Code CLI

**Quick Setup** - The server is pre-configured for Claude Code in this repository:

1. The configuration exists in `.claude/mcp-servers.json`
2. Start Claude Code in this directory - it will auto-detect the server
3. See [CLAUDE_CODE_SETUP.md](CLAUDE_CODE_SETUP.md) for global configuration and troubleshooting

### Using with VS Code

You can also use this MCP server with VS Code's agent mode (requires VS Code 1.99 or newer). To set up:

1. Create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "mcp-android": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "bash",
      "args": [
        "-c",
        "cd /path/to/mcp-adb && source .venv/bin/activate && python -m server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
